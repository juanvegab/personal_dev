            <h2>About the Event</h2>
            <p>The Roux Academy’s annual conference and exhibit is designed to foster a close-knit relationship amongst artists at various universities around the world. No matter what school you attend - if you’re an art student at an accredited art school anywhere in the world, you can attend the conference. But sign up early, as this not-to-miss conference sells out quickly, and the waiting list is long. In addition, art students are encouraged to send in works from their school portfolios to be considered for hanging in the CAC exhibit halls, as well as to be selected as a Featured Artist.</p>
         
            <h2>Schedule</h2>
            <p>With over 35 seminars and 60 exhibits at  this year&rsquo;s Roux Academy CAC, there is truly something for every art student.  Learn about color, light, and texture; see spray paint tagging in a new light,  as a breath-taking 20 ft high graffiti wall is built before your very eyes over  the course of the week; and rub paint brushes with some of the most talented  artists in the world.</p>
        
            <h3>Schedule on Monday: </h3>
            <p>The first day of <em>CAC</em> events and  exhibits is kicked off under the theme of <em>Art in Full Color.</em> From a  demonstration in graffiti art on a wall of the   Rousseau Room, to the exhibit of colorful glazed modern glassware in the  Dover Hall, <em>Art in Full Color </em>will get <em>CAC</em> started in full swing!</p>
        
            <h3>Schedule on Tuesday:  </h3>
            <p><em>Water in Art </em>is the theme for the second day, as art students from around the world  gather at the Fountain of Intrigue in the gardens of Hotel Contempo to create  ice sculptures, and art lecturers discuss the use of water as an art material,  and water as an art subject.</p>
